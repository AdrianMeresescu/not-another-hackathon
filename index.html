                <p class="center">Code Of Conduct<br /> The quick version</p>

                <p>Our hackathon is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, nationality,
                  religion, previous hackathon attendance or computing experience (or lack of any of the aforementioned). </p>

                <p>We do not tolerate harassment of hackathon participants in any form.</p>

                <p>Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate at any hackathon venue, including hacks, talks, workshops, parties, social media and other online media. </p>

                <p>Hackathon participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the hackathon without a refund (if applicable) at the discretion of the hackathon organisers.</p>

                <p>It is a period of vendor war.</p>

                <p>This is a demonstration of Star Wars-style scrolling 3D titles in CSS3. It possibly has no practical purpose whatsoever but it looks great and you can impress your friends.</p>

                <p>Before movie-buffs start ranting, I realize Star Wars wasn't the first to use crawling 3D titles, but few of you will remember the Flash Gordon series or the 1936 adaption of HG Wells' "Things to Come".</p>

                <p class="center">The Less Quick Version</p>

                <p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, nationality, or religion, sexual images in public spaces,
                  deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, photography or audio/video recording against reasonable consent, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p <p>Photography
                is encouraged, but other participants must be given a reasonable chance to opt out from being photographed. If they object to the taking of their photograph, comply with their request. It is inappropriate to take photographs in contexts
                where people have a reasonable expectation of privacy (in bathrooms or where participants are sleeping).</p <p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p <p>As this is a hackathon, we like
                to explicitly note that the hacks created at our hackathon are equally subject to the anti-harassment policy.</p <p>Sponsors and partners are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised
                images, activities, or other material. Sponsor representatives (including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.</p <p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone
                else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of hackathon staff immediately.</p <p>Hackathon staff will be happy to help participants contact any local security or local law enforcement, provide escorts,
                or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the hackathon. We value your attendance.</p <p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the hackathon organisers may take any action they deem appropriate.
                This includes warning the offender, expulsion from the hackathon with no refund (if applicable), or reporting their behaviour to local law enforcement.</p <p>We expect participants to follow these rules at hackathon and workshop venues
                and hackathon-related social events.</p>

            <h3>The Ten Chindogu Tenets</h3>

            <p>Every Chindogu is an almost useless object, but not every almost useless object is a Chindogu. In order to transcend the realms of the merely almost useless, and join the ranks of the really almost useless, certain vital criteria must be
            met. It is these criteria, a set of ten vital tenets, that define the gentle art and philosophy of Chindogu. Here they are:</p>

            <h4>1. A Chindogu cannot be for real use</h4>

            <p>It is fundamental to the spirit of Chindogu that inventions claiming Chindogu status must be, from a practical point of view, (almost) completely useless. If you invent something which turns out to be so handy that you use it all the time,
            then you have failed to make a Chindogu. Try the Patent Office.</p>

            <h4>2. A Chindogu must exist</h4>

            <p>“You’re not allowed to use a Chindogu, but it must be made. You have to be able to hold it in your hand and think ‘I can actually imagine someone using this. Almost.’ In order to be useless, it must first be.</p>

            <h4>3. Inherent in every Chindogu is the spirit of anarchy</h4>

                <p>”Chindogu are man-made objects that have broken free from the chains of usefulness. They represent freedom of thought and action: the freedom to challenge the suffocating historical dominance of conservative utility; the freedom to be (almost) useless.</p>


                  <h4>4. Chindogu are tools for everyday life</h4>

                <p>”Chindogu are a form of nonverbal communication understandable to everyone, everywhere. Specialised or technical inventions, like a three handled sprocket loosener for drainpipes centred between two under-the-sink cabinet doors (the uselessness of which will only be appreciated by plumbers), do not count.</p>

                  <h4>5. Chindogu are not for sale</h4>

                <p>”Chindogu are not tradable commodities. If you accept money for one you surrender your purity. They must not even be sold as a joke.</p>

                  <h4>6. Humour must not be the sole reason for creating a Chindogu</h4>

                <p>“The creation of Chindogu is fundamentally a problem-solving activity. Humour is simply the by-product of finding an elaborate or unconventional solution to a problem that may not have been that pressing to begin with.</p>

                <h4>7. Chindogu is not propaganda</h4>


                <p>“Chindogu are innocent. They are made to be used, even though they cannot be used. They should not be created as a perverse or ironic comment on the sorry state of mankind.</p>

                  <h4>8. Chindogu are never taboo</h4>

                  <p>The International Chindogu Society has established certain standards of social decency. Cheap sexual innuendo, humour of a vulgar nature, and sick or cruel jokes that debase the sanctity of living things are not allowed.</p>

            <h4>9. Chindogu cannot be patented</h4>

                <p>”Chindogu are offerings to the rest of the world – they are not therefore ideas to be copyrighted, patented, collected and owned. As they say in Spain, mi Chindogu es tu Chindogu.</p>

                  <h4>10. Chindogu are without prejudice</h4>

                <p>“Chindogu must never favour one race or religion over another. Young and old, male and female, rich and poor – all should have a free and equal chance to enjoy each and every Chindogu.”</p>
